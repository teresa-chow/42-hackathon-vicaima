# :rocket: Challenge

To design and implement a platform to facilitate the performance evaluation process within the organization, improving its efficiency through better communication and data handling.

</br>

## Approach

A user-friendly digital platform that supports three distinct roles, each with its own set of features tailored to their responsibilities:
`Admin (HR)`, `Assessor`, and `Assessed Employee`.

</br>

</br>

## Features

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Admin (HR)</th>
    <th>Assessor</th>
    <th>Assessed Employee</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Mass data upload (.csv) for employees;</li>
        <li>Create and management of assessment events;</li>
        <li>Monitor ongoing assessments;</li>
        <li>Delete employee data.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Access to active assessment events;</li>
        <li>View employee performance data;</li>
        <li>Assess employees and communicate the results.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Confirm knowledge of evaluations;</li>
        <li>View performance feedback from assessors.</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

</br>

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Built using `Django` with `SQLite` for data storage and management.
- **Security**: Implemented role-based access control and secure data handling using `Django`â€™s security features.
- **Frontend**: A clean and user-friendly interface to mediate interaction between users and the platform developed in `Figma`. Data views are customized based on the userâ€™s role.

</br>

## Current Status
The core functionalities of the platform have been implemented, including role-based access, performance evaluation event management, and employee data handling. We have developed a consistent user-experience through a design system that ensures interface clarity and ease of use.

</br>

## Next Steps
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ðŸ”´ Short-term</th>
    <th>ðŸŸ¡ Mid-term</th>
    <th>ðŸŸ¢ Long-term</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Implement a data dashboard for enhanced visualization of organizational performance data and a mechanism for evaluated users to confirm their knowledge of evaluation results.</td>
    <td>Add additional features to enhance each role's capabilities.</td>
    <td>Continuously adapt the platform to meet Vicaimaâ€™s specific organizational needs by introducing new variables and features.</td>
